Heyyy! I'm Preston Nabors, a familiar face across the vibrant campus of Union University. You'll often find me enthusiastically engaged in a myriad of clubs and campus activities. I extend a warm invitation to connect and get to know me better – I thrive on forging new connections and witnessing the genuine joy in people's lives. 
        Embracing the diverse range of clubs our campus offers, there's something for every personality to enjoy. Among them, my heart belongs to SAC – the Student Activities Council – where the magic of about 6-8 major events annually brings our student community together. If you share my passion for meeting fellow Union enthusiasts and embracing the spirit of our university, SAC is an absolute must-join.
        My journey extends beyond SAC as well. I'm actively involved in ENACTUS, a club dedicated to proactively addressing real-world challenges through innovative business solutions that benefit our local community. A good example of one of a successful ENACTUS project is the Cyber Recycling Team. The Cyber Recycling team takes old and rundown laptops,
        refurbishes them, and gives them to students to use. Through Life139, I passionately engage in discussions about pro-life topics, working to influence governmental decisions and support individuals considering complex choices like abortion. Then there's Philosophy Hour, a space where I dive deep into captivating conversations about theology and 
        philosophy. Another club I am in is ACM, a meeting place for students working in the computer science department. In students serving seniors, we visit nursing or retirement homes and spend time with some of the senile residents, which often really makes their day. Among these clubs are some other programming that I enjoy participating in.
        In Room in the Inn, you get the opportunity to serve homeless men in the community, some of whom are really cool to get to talk to. I also love participating in campus and community day, a great opportunity for Union students to give back to the community in service.
